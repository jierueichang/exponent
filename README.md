# exponent
A project with the aim of creating an community-created, affordable, powerful, lightweight and modern graphing calculator based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and the Python Programming Language.

As this project is to be community-created, there aren't many functions yet. Feel free to commit!

Exponent currently runs on Python 2.7. Libraries required:
- Python `math` library
- `wolframalpha` library for Wolfram|Alpha functionality
- `pygame` library for graphics
