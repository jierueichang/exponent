# Exponent
A project with the aim of creating an community-created, affordable, powerful, lightweight and modern scientific (and eventually graphing) calculator based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and the Python Programming Language.

As this project is to be community-created, there aren't many functions yet. Feel free to commit!

## Run Exponent on a PC

Exponent currently runs on Python 2.7. Libraries required:
- Python `math` library
- `wolframalpha` library for WolframAlpha functionality
- `pygame` library for graphics

To start Exponent, run `python interface.py`. Use the keyboard to type commands, and press enter to calculate. Virtual button functionality coming soon.

## Build an Exponent calculator
*Under construction, still creating Sketchup Files*
